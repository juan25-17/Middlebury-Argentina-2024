                <div class="pll2"> <p>Before visiting a hospital or private physician, students should contact Geo Blue to report their medical condition and request authorization. Geo Blue's telephone number is 001-610-254-8771, option 1. Each student's member number is on the Geoblue ID card provided by Middlebury by mail before arrival and, once in BA, on the emergency phone card provided at the beginning of the semester. However, if they do not have the card at that time, it is sufficient to mention their full name and the city where they are at the moment.
                    In case of going to the hospital, bring a personal identification (original passport or photocopy).
                    If, for any reason, a student visits a hospital without prior authorization from Geo Blue, or if he/she visits a doctor who is not affiliated with Geo Blue, and pays for the medical services received, he/she may request a reimbursement of expenses. To do so, the student will need to send Geo Blue (by mail) a Reimbursement Form and a copy of proof of the money spent. Geo Blue will also reimburse medication expenses, for which the Reimbursement Form and proof of expenses from the pharmacy must also be submitted.</p></div>

                <div class="subt"> <h3>WITH CRIMINAL COMPLAINT</h3></div>
                <div class="pll1"><p> A criminal complaint in case of sexual assault may be filed exclusively by the victim at the police
                    station nearest the crime scene. It is important not to wash before reporting the crime.</p></div>
                <div class="pll1"><p> The police staff will summon the Flying Squad for Urgent Intervention with Sexual Assault
                    Victims (Brigada Móvil de Intervención en Urgencias con Víctimas de Delitos Sexuales). The
                    service is guaranteed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It operates only in the Autonomous City
                    of Buenos Aires.</p></div>
                <div class="pll1"><p> A psychologist and a social worker are part of this squad, and they will assist the victim at the
                    police station and later, take her to a hospital.</p></div>
                <div class="pll1"><p> There, preventive HIV treatment, antibiotics for sexually transmitted diseases (ETS, for its
                    Spanish achronym) and emergency contraceptive medication will be provided, and a forensic 
                    expert will examine the victim.</p></div>
                <div class="pll1"><p> Later, the victim will be taken to the Identification Unit (División de Individualización Criminal),
                    where she will be able to identify the assailant through an identikit. She will be accompanied to
                    the Forensic Medical Center as well, in accordance with the provisions of the Judge.</p></div>
                <div class="pll1"><p> Once the medical examination is over, the Flying Squad can also take the victim and her relatives
                    home.</p></div>
                <div class="pll1"><p> This Team will also be present when supplemental reports or pictures recognition are needed in
                        order to identify the assailant.</p></div>

                    <div class="pll1"><p> In Argentina there is a National Protocol in place to assist victims of rape and sexual assault. This
                        protocol states that the victim’s right to access medical attention and professional support
                        prevails even when the (adult) victim decides not to report the crime.</p></div>
                    <div class="pll1"><p> In case the victim prefers not to report the incident to the police, she must ask for preventive
                        medication for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases at the Hospital Alemán Emergency  Room
                        (at Av. Pueyrredón and Beruti) and, at her own discretion, for contraceptive medication.</p></div>
